toolboxes (https://github.com/containers/toolbox) are cool.

Here are a few initialization scripts for toolboxes.

* `build` prefix automatically builds and installs a/the tool (not installing dependencies into the actual system)
* `dev` prefix composes a build/dev environment
* `dep` prefix for common dependency sets.
* `host` prefix for commands that are hosted inside a container because of dynamically linked dependencies
